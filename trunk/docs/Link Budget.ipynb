    "# Link Budget\n",
    "\n",
    "Mach 30 is designing a radio to receive transmissions from satellites (a ground station), named Ground Sphere. One of the most crucial calculations for determining whether the ground station's design will be able to receive the signals transmitted by a given satellite is the link budget. Simply put, a link budget factors in all gains and losses in the system composed of the transmitter (satellite) and receiver (ground station), and everything in between. \n",
    "\n",
    "The calculations themsleves are implemented by a python class named LinkBudget. The class models what are generally the most significant factors in calculating a link budget. Because there are many factors that are difficult or impossible to accurately factor in, such as the amount a given storm may introduce noise into the system, several aspects of the budget are averages or otherwise estimated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test case presented, the LinkBudget class uses the broadcast frequency of the satellite radio system, as well as its total estimated power (gain) as a basis of calculation (more information on this will be provided later). Next, some trigonometry is performed to determine the distance the satellite might be from the ground station in an observation window to factor in propagation loss due to the signal spreading as it travels from the satellite to the ground staiton. This distance and the frequency are also used to determine the loss in signal strength due to it having to travel through air, otherwise known as the free space propagation loss. Possible noise generated by weather and other background sources such as microwave ovens are also factored in when applicable. Lastly, the capabilities of the ground station to amplify the signal are also taken into account. \n"

    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**gain** / **loss** - Gain refers to how well a component converts its input power to its output. For a radio, this describes its ability to convert its input power to output. For transmitting, its output is radio waves, and for receiving, this is the power of the signal as it reaches the radio. For a component of the system, this refers to how much it similarly increases (gain) or decreases (loss) the power from the radio to antenna, or the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "**dB** - decibels. This is a unit to describe the power of a signal in reference to another value, such as Watts. It is tipically represented in reference to this other value (for example, dBw is decibels in reference ot Watts), often abbreviated to dB. The units are in a logarithmic scale, meaning 10dB is 10 times as powerful as 0, 20dB is 100 times as powerful,  etc."

    "## Broadcast Power\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever information is sent from one place to another, such as when a satellite transmits an image down to Earth to be received by a radio on the ground (ground station), the power (gain) of the signal being transmitted from the satellite is a critical factor in how well it will be able to be received by the ground station. This section of the document serves as a guide to determining what the gain of the source of the transmission may be. In some cases, the gain may be known, but in other cases it must be estimated based on knowledge of the components of the radio system used to transmit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event that you do not know what the gain of the transmitter is, there are a few methods one might use to determine it. Some satellites have their broadcast frequency publicy available, such as with the NOAA satellites. This may be on the organizations website, but a great source is the Earth Observation Portal's [Satellite Mission Database](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions), which contains detailed information about a wide number of satellites, all in one place. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot access this information, you may have to make some estimates based upon known equipment of the transmitter, or simply make a guess for the purposes of calculating your link budget. If your attempting to calculate an estimate, knowing what the gain of the antenna, radio, and amplifier are is helpful, where you may then  be able to use a conservative estimate for the loss of other components in the system. This estimate may be 1.0db to 1.5db of loss in the 100MHz range (or higher for longer lengths of transmission line). This will decrease in higher frequencies due to the need for components of the transmission system such as filters or wave guides to be tightly matched to the transmission frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Gain Estimation ###\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example of this estimate, we will use a 25W transmitter, and an antenna with a 6dB gain. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must convert the transmitter's Watts to dBw so that we can calculate the overall gain of the transmission using the same units. Since dBw are a logarithmic scaled unit in reference to Watts, the conversion is simply 10 * log10(W), or 10 * log10(25), which is equal to 13.9794 (rounded).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is listing all of the other components involved in the transmission process. For this example, we will assume there is a transmission wire, a frequency filter (used to ensure that only a range or band of frequencies are transmitted), and associated connectors. As an estimate for a 10 meter (33 feet) transmission wire, it has a loss of 0.05dBw. Note that this increases exponentially with the length of the wire. Our estimate for this example of the loss from the filter and connectors is an additional 0.5dBw.\n",
    "\n",
    "With values for the gain and loss of each of the components, we can now simply add them together to determine the transmission gain. Note that all units are dBw. 14 + -0.5 + -0.05 + -0.5 + 6 = 18.95dBw\n"
