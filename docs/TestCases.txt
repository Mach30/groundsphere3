Proposed Test Cases

1) GS Mk 3
    - This is the one described in our documentation already

2) GS Mk 3 High Elevation Angle
    - Mostly the same as #1, but his a higher elevation angle, and therefore less pointing loss for the antenna

3) GS Mk 3 Low Elevation Angle
    - Similar to #2, but with a low elevation angle, and greater pointing loss
    - This link budget may generate a negative margin, which is fine as a point of test

4) GS Mk 3 High Gain Antenna, With Tracking
    - 

5) GS Mk 3 High Gain Antenna, no tracking
