    "Mach 30 is designing a satellite communications ground station to receive broadcasts form satellites, named Ground Sphere. One of the most crucial calculations for determining whether the ground station's design will be able to receive the signals broadcast by a given satellite is the link budget. Simply put, a link budget factors in all gains and losses in the system composed of the broadcaster (satellite) and receiver (ground station), and everything in between. \n",
    "\n",
    "The calculations themsleves are implemented by a python class named LinkBudget. The class models what are generally the most significant factors in calculating a link budget. Because there are many factors that are difficult or impossible to accurately factor in, such as the amount a given storm may introduce noise into the system, several aspects of the budget are averages or otherwise estimated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test case presented, the LinkBudget class uses the broadcast frequency of the satellite radio system, as well as its total estimated gain as a basis of calculation (more information on this will be provided later). Next, some trigonometry is performed to determine the distance the satellite might be from the ground station in an observation window to factor in propagation loss due to the signal spreading as it travels from the satellite to the ground staiton. This distance and the frequency are also used to determine the loss in signal strength due to it having to travel through air, otherwise known as the free space propagation loss. Possible noise generated by weather and other background sources such as microwave ovens are also factored in when applicable. Lastly, the capabilities of the ground station to amplify the signal are also taken into account. \n"
